# Headers

## Website Header

HTTP header is a field of an HTTP request/response that passes additional context and metadata about the request/response. 

For example, a request message can use headers to indicate it's preferred media formats, while a response can use header to indicate the media format of the returned body. 

Headers are case-insensitive, begin at the start of a line and are immediately followed by a ':' and a header-dependent value.
